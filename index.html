					This project is under the <i>Open Innovation</i> theme:
					<br><br>
					Streaming and curating content for DishTV online using Facial Recognition and Gender Analysis
				</section>
				<section>
					<i>Brief Intro</i>
					<br><br>
					At a glance, this project is just a simple web application with one goal in mind - craving for something new.
					End-users can create their accounts on the portal to find exclusive curated content based on their Gender and Age.
				</section>
				<section>
					 And, apart from providing curated content based on gender (and age), users can stream the videos 
					 in real-time. Plus, we are putting every user's credential hash on a central blockchain for 
					 security purposes.
					<br><br>
					Using a JS-library called <i>nude.js</i> (no pun intended) every video being uploaded to the portal can be moderated 
					to be filtered for unsafe, offensive, vulgar and adult content.
				</section>
				<section>
					<i>So, how does it work?</i>
					<br><br>
					<ul>
						<li>End-user comes on the portal and initiates account creation.</li>
						<li>A channel package is selected and compliance for using our curated content is duly noted.</li>
						<li>User credentials are hashed together on a central blockchain for security (and sales growth) purposes.</li>
						<li>Appropriate services are served depending on the previous choices made.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					The <i>Tech Stack</i>
					<br><br>
					Developed in MEAN Stack and hosted on Heroku, it's by far <i>the modern development</i> environment.
					The web-app uses browser-cache as its own standalone service worker aka offline content provider.
					The facial recognition system uses the GCP Cloud Vision API to provide JSON-formatted data about user sex and age.
				</section>
				<section>
					<i>Why?</i>
					<br><br>
					This is for you, if:
					<ul>
						<li>you want exclusive curated content on-demand.</li>
						<li>you like gap-free (and ad-free) pure entertainment.</li>
						<li>you are a homo-sapien.</li>
						<li>and, obviously, if you love DishTV.</li>
					</ul>
