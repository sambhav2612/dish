					This project is under the <i>Open Innovation</i> theme:
					<br><br>
					Streaming and curating content for DishTV online using Blockchain and Gender Analysis
				</section>
				<section>
					<i>Brief Intro</i>
					<br><br>
					At a glance, this project is just a lame PWA filled with whip cream and topped with chocolate and sprinkles.
					The DishTV users can create their accounts on the portal to find curated content based
					 on their Gender (obviously, after taking consent ;)
				</section>
				<section>
					 And, apart from providing curated content based on gender (and age), users can stream the "things" 
					 in real-time. Plus, we are putting every user's credential hash on a central blockchain for 
					 security purposes.
				</section>
				<section>
					<i>So, how does it work?</i>
					<br><br>
					<ul>
						<li>End-user comes on the portal and initiates account creation.</li>
						<li>A channel package is selected and compliance for using our curated content is duly noted.</li>
						<li>User credentials are hashed together on a central blockchain for security (and sales growth) purposes.</li>
						<li>Appropraite services are served depending on the previous choices made.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<i>Why?</i>
					<br><br>
					This is for you, if:
					<ul>
						<li>you want curated content on-demand.</li>
						<li>you like gap-free entertainment.</li>
						<li>you are a homo-sapien.</li>
						<li>and, obviously, if you love DishTV.</li>
					</ul>
